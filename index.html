                This section aims to give an overview of The Gotita Project, 
                the current situation of WASH assignments in the World and Colombia, 
                and how we will tackle the problem.

            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <hr style="border: none;">
            <p>
                In 2017, an estimated 1.2 million people died as a result of 
                unsafe water sources. This was <strong>2.2%</strong> of global deaths.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this reason, multiple NGOs are now trying to improve this 
                aspect and improve the quality of life of those who lived in 
                undeserved areas. Nevertheless, there are too much challenges 
                that WASH units are facing now.

            <h3>Experiences from the field</h3>
            <p> 
                "Right now, in refugee camps, water monitoring it is a costly, 
                time consuming and inefficient process. To measure water quality 
                we need a high number of people and during rainy seasons we need 
                to transport them in helicopter. Furthermore, data is being taken 
                by hand, which is highly time consuming."

            </p>
            <p>
                "People from San Isidro of Puerto Caldas in Colombia have recurrently 
                problems with water quality due to illegal embezzlement of water networks. 
                Our company is only ensuring good water quality to the people that is 
                currently subscribe to our services."

            <h3>Challenges faced ensuring water quality</h3>
            <p>
                To ensure water quality we need to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Measure some parameters of water quality at least twice a day in risk areas, and once a day in more safe ones.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Too many changes are faced ensuring water quality, even though we agree that:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Rural zones are the most affected ones. The more distant they are from cities, the worst water quality will be.</li>
                <li>Its difficult to ensure water quality with manual techniques in a daily basis.</li>
                <li>Measuring water quality can require a lot of ressources and costly.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Our solution</h2>
            <hr style="border: none;">
            <p>
                We aim with this project to design a device that can aloud either public utility 
                companies, households or WAHS teams from NGOs, to measure at distance and automatically 
                water quality.
