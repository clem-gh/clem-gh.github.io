                This section aims to give an overview of The Gotita Project, 
                the current situation of WASH assignments in the World and Colombia, 
                and how we will tackle the problem.

            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <hr style="border: none;">
            <p>
                In 2017, an estimated 1.2 million people died as a result of 
                unsafe water sources. This was <strong>2.2%</strong> of global deaths.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this reason, multiple NGOs are now trying to improve this 
                aspect and improve the quality of life of those who lived in 
                undeserved areas. Nevertheless, there are too much challenges 
                that WASH units are facing now.

            <h3>Experiences from the field</h3>
            <p> 
                "Right now, in refugee camps, water monitoring it is a costly, 
                time consuming and inefficient process. To measure water quality 
                we need a high number of people and during rainy seasons in some cases we had 
                to transport them by helicopter. Furthermore, data is being taken 
                by hand, which is highly time consuming."

            <p>
                "In vulnerable communities of Colombia it is well known that most of the  
                problems with water quality is due to illegal embezzlement of the water network. 
                Public water companies can only ensure good water quality to the people that is 
                currently subscribe to their services."

            <h3>Challenges faced ensuring water quality</h3>
            <p>
                The most important actions to ensure water quality are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Measure some parameters of water quality at least twice a day in risk areas, and once a day in more safe ones.</li>
                <li>Measure in a monthly basis all parameters from IRCA index by law.</li>
                <li>Ensure that the water source is not being polluted by human activities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Too many challenges are faced ensuring water quality:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Rural zones are the most affected ones. The more distant they are from cities, the more difficult it is to measure water quality and do maintainance of the water network.</li>
                <li>Measuring water quality in laboratories in highly time consuming and can be even impossible in some cases because samples need to be fresh.</li>
                <li>Measuring water quality can require a lot of ressources and costly.</li>
                <li>It is not impossible that water can be polluted at any moment.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Our solution</h2>
            <hr style="border: none;">
            <p>
                We aim with this project to design a device that can aloud either public utility 
                companies, households or WAHS teams from NGOs, to measure at distance and automatically 
                some of the water quality parameters.
